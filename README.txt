Introduction!

The MolDockPro:
	This package processes Ligands from docking, in preparation for a comprehensive analysis in form of Trajectory. 
Computational molecular docking is used by computational Chemist to predict ligand-protein bound conformation as well as free binding energies. Howerver challanges arises from the workable/appropriate format required for the down stream analysis. The combination of all docked  posess into a single trajectory file (.pdb) emerges as a universal format for majority of analysis tools like, MDanalysis, MDtraj and a Grommacs Analysis Suit. Therefore MolDockPro utilizes some of the reknown tools to covert *pdbqt files to pdb and then combined all the pdb files obtained with bash.
